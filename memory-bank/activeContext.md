- Added automatic endpoint hashing via database trigger
- Created atomic increment function for thread-safe request counting
- Fixed unique constraint issues in the reddit_api_usage table
- Enhanced error handling for API rate limiting and usage tracking

### Database Optimizations
- Added endpoint_hash column for efficient lookups and consistent storage
- Implemented proper constraints and indexes for API usage tracking
- Created database-level functions for atomic operations
- Improved data integrity with proper unique constraints

### Recent Changes
1. Updated ProjectSubreddits component to display online users count in the same format as SavedList
2. Enhanced refreshSubredditData function to:
   - Update both subscriber_count and active_users in database
   - Update local state with latest data
   - Add debug logging for tracking data updates
3. Maintained consistent styling between project and saved list views

### Projects Page Layout Update (Latest)
- Standardized the Projects page layout to match the SavedList component styling
- Key changes to `src/pages/Projects.tsx`:
  1. Container styling:
     - Added `max-w-[1200px]` for consistent width constraint
     - Added `mx-auto` for horizontal centering
     - Implemented responsive padding with `px-4 md:px-8`
  2. Loading state optimization:
     - Simplified loading state container structure
     - Removed unnecessary padding wrapper
  3. Responsive design improvements:
     - Maintained consistent spacing across different screen sizes
     - Preserved existing responsive behavior for project cards

## Active Decisions

### 1. Type Safety
- Use unknown for initial API responses
- Validate all parsed data
- Provide specific error types
- Maintain strict type checking

### 2. Analysis Quality
- Analyze top 50 posts for better insights
- Validate all analysis components
- Provide meaningful defaults
- Ensure database compatibility

### 3. Error Handling
- Implement specific error messages
- Add retry logic for API failures
- Provide graceful degradation
- Maintain data consistency

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Test analysis improvements
2. Monitor error handling
3. Validate database integration
4. Check type safety coverage

### Short-term Goals
