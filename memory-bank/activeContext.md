# Active Context

## Current Focus
Working on the subreddit analysis feature, specifically:
1. Fixing issues with the Rules section in analysis results
2. Improving the save functionality
3. Handling JSON parsing errors from OpenRouter API

## Recent Changes

### Analysis Component Updates
1. Modified SubredditAnalysis component:
   - Rules section now expanded by default
   - Added event propagation prevention
   - Improved save button visibility and functionality
   - Enhanced error handling for save operations

2. OpenRouter Integration:
   - Added robust JSON parsing with fallback strategies
   - Improved error handling for malformed responses
   - Added retry logic for failed requests

3. Database Integration:
   - Updated subreddit saving logic
   - Added proper error handling
   - Improved type safety

## Active Decisions

### 1. Analysis Display
- Keep Rules section expanded by default for better UX
- Prevent re-analysis when interacting with analysis sections
- Show save button consistently in new analysis mode
- Use clear loading states during analysis

### 2. Error Handling
- Implement robust JSON parsing for OpenRouter responses
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Add retry logic for transient failures
- Log detailed errors for debugging

### 3. Data Management
- Cache analysis results in localStorage
- Use optimistic updates for better UX
- Implement proper type safety
- Handle edge cases in data transformation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Test and verify Rules section fixes
2. Monitor OpenRouter response handling
3. Verify save functionality
4. Add loading indicators

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement analysis result caching
2. Add batch analysis capabilities
3. Improve error recovery
4. Enhance performance

## Known Issues

### 1. Analysis
- Occasional JSON parsing errors from OpenRouter
- Re-analysis triggering on section expansion
- Save button visibility inconsistencies

### 2. Performance
- Large analysis results causing UI lag
- Multiple rapid analyses causing rate limits
- Cache invalidation edge cases

### 3. UX
- Inconsistent loading states
- Error message clarity
- Section expansion behavior

## Current Questions
1. Should we implement rate limiting for analysis requests?
2. How to handle very large subreddit datasets?
3. What additional error recovery strategies needed?
4. How to improve analysis result caching?

## Recent Learnings
1. OpenRouter response format inconsistencies
2. Event propagation impact on analysis
3. Save operation edge cases
4. Performance implications of large datasets

## Active Experiments
